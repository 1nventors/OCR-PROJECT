📖 OCR License Plate Recognition

This project is a simple Optical Character Recognition (OCR) application using pytesseract and OpenCV.
It detects contours in an image (such as a license plate), applies preprocessing filters, and extracts text.

⚙️ Features

Image preprocessing: grayscale, thresholding, bilateral filter, median blur

Contour detection and bounding box for regions of interest

Cropping and resizing detected areas for better OCR results

Text recognition with pytesseract (multi-language support available)
